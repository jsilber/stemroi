# Python environment setup - on Ubuntu

# Become root (unless otherwise noted, assume we are running commands as root)
sudo su -

# Check if Python2, Python3 and their respective pips are installed:
python -V
python3 -V
pip -V
pip3 -V

# If Python 3 is not installed, used the following:
apt-get install python3 python3-pip3

# Install virtualenvwrapper (and virtualenv) into Python3:
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

# Exit to regular user (jslinux, etc.) and change to home directory
exit
cd ~

# Open ~/.bashrc in a text editor and add the following at the end of the file:

# Virtualenvwrapper
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python3"
# virtual environment home
export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
# project home
export PROJECT_HOME=~/Documents/projects
# load up the wrapper script
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

# Close you terminal window and open it again--if you see no errors, you are
# all set!


# To list all projects in your PROJECT_HOME:
workon

# To switch virtualenvs (to a project or between projects) to one of
# your projects:
workon <project_name> # workon stemroi

# To exist the current virtualenv and get back to your default command-line environment:
deactivate

# To make a new Python 2 project in PROJECT_HOME:
mkproject <project_name>

# To make a new Python 3 project in PROJECT_HOME:
mkproject -p /usr/local/bin/python3 <project_name>

# To add an existing Python project to virtualenvwrapper, place code directory
# in ~/Documents/work and then:
mkvirtualenv -a ~/Documents/projects/<project_name> <project_name>

# To delete a project but keep the project folder in PROJECT_HOME:
rmvirtualenv <project_name>
